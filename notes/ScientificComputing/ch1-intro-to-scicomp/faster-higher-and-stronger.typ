= 2 Faster, Higher and Stronger

There are three themes in scientific computing. They are efficiency, accuracy and stability, associated with which is the spirit of numerics: "faster, higher and stronger".

- *Faster*. faster (larger speed) in efficiency

- *Higher*. higher order in accuracy

- *Stronger*. stronger in stability (robustness)

An inefficient, inaccurate or unstable method may lead to bad accumulation of discretization and implementation errors, and yield totally wrong results.
